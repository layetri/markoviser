# Markoviser
Markoviser is a Markov Chain-based algorithm that transforms existing MIDI into new compositions. It was written in Racket/Scheme for an assignment at HKU University of the Arts Utrecht, the Netherlands, by DaniÃ«l Kamp.

### What it does
Simple. You import a MIDI file, select a destination and the program does the work.
